        Allow me to introduce myself, I'm Nelson Foster Jr. Originally, I
        started my professional journey as a union carpenter, where I honed my
        skills and craftsmanship. However, due to medical reasons, I had to step
        away from carpentry and seek a new path that would challenge my mind. I
        was eager to find a profession that would engage my intellect and allow
        me to grow.
